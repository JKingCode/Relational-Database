# Relational-Database

Tokenizer: This code takes in a text file as input, and breaks the string into different token objects. These token objects turn the input into an input that the relational database can use. 

Scanner: increases functionality of the relational database by checking for proper relational database syntax. 

Database: This is the point when the program really emerges as a database. Elements stored in the database are listed as domains.
